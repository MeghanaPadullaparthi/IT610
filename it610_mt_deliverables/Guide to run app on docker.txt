For Single conatiner 
1- Docker and Docker Compose should be installed.
2-Clone your repo and go to the your code directory where your dockerfile is located.

4- After building docker image you just need to run "docker-compose up -d"  tis will bring up your single container.
5- you can check you app is running or not by running "curl localhost:3000"  or yourmachineip:3000 in your browser
e.g 10.10.0.10:3000

For multi container
1- Docker and Docker Compose should be installed.
2- Clone your repo and go to the your code directory where your dockerfile is located.
3- Do not make image if you have already build image in single container.For making docker image you need to run the command  "docker build . -t is332-app"
4- After building docker image you need to make your system part of swarm manager for that we need to run "docker swarm init" this will initlize your machine into a swar manager.
5- Now create a docker network that will be used by swarm for that run "docker network create --driver=overlay is332-app"
